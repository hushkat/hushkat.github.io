      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I took on the challenge to participate in Industrial Intrusion CTF by TryHackMe, it was a challenge that blends classic offensive security tactics with the niche world of Industrial Control Systems (ICS).
It offered a fun and insightful mix of categories including Web exploitation, OSINT, Forensics, and a light Boot2Root (B2R) experienceâ€&amp;ldquo;perfect for anyone looking to dip their toes into ICS-focused challenges.
These writeups walk through my step-by-step approach in solving some of the easiest challenges, how I navigated each section, and what made this ICS-themed room both accessible and educational.
Whether you&amp;rsquo;re new to TryHackMe or curious about the crossover between IT and OT security, this is a solid place to start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
