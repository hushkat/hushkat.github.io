# OwntheLib: Ado0re
## Description
- Points: 100
- Web URL: http://173.212.253.48:6061

This was an easy web challenge focused on IDOR vulnerability. 

## What is IDOR?
IDOR stands for Insecure Direct Object Reference. Its a type of access control vulnerability that occurs when an application exposes a reference to an internal object (like a file, database record, or user ID) without properly verifying whether the user is authorized to access it.

## Why its dangerous:
An attacker can:
- Access or modify other users' data
- Download files or view records they shouldn't see
- Potentially escalate privileges if sensitive data is exposed

For this challenge, my Exploitation Tool of choice was - Burpsuite. I created an account on the target website and signed in. I was welcomed by this dashboard:

![Dashboard](/images/KenyaCyberlympics/Dashboard.png)

I will immediately say, what caught my eye is the reference used to my personal account using that ID on the URL. So I Interecepted a request to my account dashboard using burpsuite:

```
GET /members/46 HTTP/1.1

Connection: keep-alive
```

I then sent this to intruder, and used a sniper attack with a payload number list from 0-50 and caught request 9 with a different response from the rest of the reponses. This is how the application responded, and the flag was there:

```

Can you spot the flag: `Ado0re :acdfctf{I_4DoRe_Id0Rs}`

# OwntheLib: S3A
## Description
- Points: 100
- I might just leave this right here as a bonus flag but what could that two star {*} mean ðŸ¤¨.
- IV: bb751cd8c0b8b08978cea57ed9a1933f
- Hex: 33a3267fac260a140588bf9a461c85e25a8e04c304ac82d2d26ad64090105e34
- Key: my_secure_aesk**

## Breaking AES with Partial Key Brute Force
## Challenge Summary

We were given:
- An Initialization Vector (IV)
- A ciphertext (in hex)
- An AES key with two unknown characters at the end

The goal was to recover the full AES key and decrypt the ciphertext to get the flag.

## What is AES?
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that requires:
- A secret key (128, 192, or 256 bits)
- An IV (for modes like CBC) to ensure unique ciphertexts even with the same key and plaintext.

Given Data:
- IV = bb751cd8c0b8b08978cea57ed9a1933f
- Ciphertext = 33a3267fac260a140588bf9a461c85e25a8e04c304ac82d2d26ad64090105e34
- Partial Key =	my_secure_aesk** (two last characters unknown)

## Attack Approach
Since the last two characters of the AES key were unknown, we performed a brute-force search over all plausible combinations for these two positions.

## Why brute force?
The key is 16 characters long (AES-128).
Only two characters were missing Ã¢â€ ' manageable number of guesses (~95Â² = 9025 if using common printable characters).
For each key guess, decrypt the ciphertext and check if the plaintext looks valid.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3
- PyCryptodome library for AES decryption

Here is an AI-generated script to ease our task (PS: I'm not a very good programmer/script writer for that matter. But hey, thats what we have AI for, right?)

```
from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES
from Cryptodome.Util.Padding import unpad
from itertools import product
import string

# Provided IV and ciphertext in hex
iv = bytes.fromhex("bb751cd8c0b8b08978cea57ed9a1933f")
ciphertext = bytes.fromhex("33a3267fac260a140588bf9a461c85e25a8e04c304ac82d2d26ad64090105e34")

key_prefix = "my_secure_aesk"
charset = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "_{}!@#$%^&*()-=+"

for c1, c2 in product(charset, repeat=2):
    key = (key_prefix + c1 + c2).encode()
    try:
        cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
        decrypted = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
        plaintext = unpad(decrypted, AES.block_size).decode()

        if "flag" in plaintext or "{" in plaintext:
            print(f"[+] Key found: {key.decode()}")
            print(f"[+] Flag: {plaintext}")
            break
    except Exception:
        continue
```
I then ran this script as shown below, can you spot the flag: 

```
python3 crypt.py

[+] Key found: my_secure_aeskey
[+] Plaintext: acdfCTF{34sy_43S_3ncrypt10n}
```
